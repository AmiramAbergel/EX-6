Tests for freeBigInt() function:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Important note: the BigInt_st structure takes up 24 bytes on the server!!!

Resetting virtual heap with 0 allocated blocks and maximum capacity of 10000 bytes.
newBigInt("-000987654321000",  1) results in new BigInt object with sign='-', exp=11, mantissa="9". Allocated 26 bytes in  2 blocks in virtual stack.
After freeing the BigInt object there are  0 bytes allocated in  0 blocks in virtual stack.
Resetting virtual heap with 0 allocated blocks and maximum capacity of 10000 bytes.
